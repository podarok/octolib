    /// - **Anthropic** ✓ — explicit `cache_control` ephemeral; TTL resets on read;

    ///   for Anthropic/Claude routes. Returns `Some` when model is Claude-family.
    /// - **OpenAI** ✗ — GPT-5.6 supports explicit write breakpoints, but exposes
    ///   no client-controlled refresh/keepalive primitive. A duplicate request
    ///   can incur another cache-write charge rather than extending a TTL. `None`.
    /// - **Google Gemini** ✗ via chat completion — implicit cache only here; the
    ///   explicit `cachedContent` resource lives behind a separate REST endpoint
    ///   and is refreshed by `PATCH cachedContents/{id}` with a new `expireTime`,
    ///   not by sending messages. Out of scope for the SendCachedPrefix model.
    ///   `None`.
    /// - **Amazon Bedrock** ✗ today — current octolib impl uses the OpenAI-compat
    ///   endpoint and does not yet inject `cache_control`. When that lands, swap
    ///   to `Some` matching the Anthropic policy for Claude models.
    /// - **DeepSeek / Groq / Moonshot Kimi K2** ✗ — automatic disk/prefix caching
    ///   with no client-controllable refresh primitive. `None`.
    /// - **Cloudflare / Together / Fireworks / Cerebras / Nvidia / BytePlus /
    ///   Alibaba / Minimax / Featherless / Hetzner / OpenCode Zen & Go / Octohub /
